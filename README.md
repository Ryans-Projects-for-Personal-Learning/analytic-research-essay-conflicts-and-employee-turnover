# About the Assignment

This essay was written for SOC3142: Applied Statistical Analysis where using data from the General Social Survey (GSS), Cycle 30 survey, 3 variables had to be chosen to perform univariate and bivariate analysis. The program used to perform the statistical analyses is the Statistical Package of the Social Sciences (SPSS). With this program and the statistical skills learned in class, I applied the knowledge obbtained to determine the statistical signifiance between these variables. 

# About the Essay

In this essay, I explore the following 3 variables:
* WLY_145: Number of Weeks Worked at the Job - Past 12 Months
* JSR_02: Job Satisfaction
* SFC_07: Conflicts with Supervisor or Manager - Past 12 Months

WLY_145 is the dependent variable while JSR_02 and SFC_07 are the independent variables. I was interested in finding out whether or not there was a correlation between the dependent variable and the independent variables. 

The essay is broken down into the following sections:
* Introduction
* Literature Review
* Data Set Descriptions and Univariate Analysis
* Bivariate Analysis
* Discussion
* Conclusion
* References
* Appendix

## Introduction and Literature Review

Here, I introduce the subject and its significance to us. Using academic articles, I refer to relevant studies to help write a conclusion that was reached by these studies. 

## Data Set Descriptions

This section contains a table of characteristics that the chosen variables have. 

## Univariate Analysis

Univariate analysis is the analysis of a single variable. With this, a few basic measurements such as the mean, median and mode were obtained for the variables depending on their variable level. 

## Bivariate Analysis

Bivariate analysis is the analysis of relationships between two variables. With this, I applied statistical methods such as inferential tests and measures of associations between WLY_145 with each independent variable and between the two independent variables to determine if a relationship existed. 

## Discussion and Conclusion 

These sections summarize the findings of the essay, what conclusions can be drawn and further discusses this research topic and what the next steps could be.

## Appendix and References

The appendix contains SPSS syntax for generating the graphs and tables and the references are the citations to the academic journals used for the literature review. If you would like to see more of the syntax and the graphs generated, you can find them in the "graphs" and "syntax" folders respectively.
